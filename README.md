# pacmen_factory
## The object of this game is to create pacmen images usting the "add pacmen" button. Then afterwards you would press "Start Game" to make the pacmen move in random directions. Each time you click the "Start Game" button, you increase the speed with which the pacmen move. To further improve the program, I would like to add animation to the js code to give the images animations of the pacmen's mouths opening and closing as they move. Also for their heads to face in the opposite direction
